# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## Modifications

* The test and training data was merged into one dataset.
* Selecting only the mean and sd measurements.
* Altering the names so that they are more descriptive.
* Creating an independent tidy data set with averages of each variable for each activity and subject

## Identififiers

* Subject: ID of the Subject
* Activity: Activity performed by the subject

### Feature list

The features from the database are generated from the accelerometer and gyroscope using the 3-axial signals of X, Y and Z. The accelerator was further subdivided into body and gravity acceleration signals. 
Some of the signals were then fast Fourier transformed and these are denoted with an f. The couple list is as follows:
